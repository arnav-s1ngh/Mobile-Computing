so, the first app is pretty simple. a dao, database and entity. used an accelerometer and gyroscope to calculate the 3 angles. created graph using ycharts. imp thing to note is that the graph doesn't update dynamically so that when a new entity is spawned with time, it doesn't change, so i just hardcoded the data from the logger. and that's the same thing i used to export data to my system using the adb command, and then used a simple linear regression to predict the next value, since it was all the same because my data didn't change over time, the predicted values pretty much match the actual values.
