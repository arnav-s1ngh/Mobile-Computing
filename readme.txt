so, the first app is pretty simple. a dao, database and entity. used accelerometer and gyroscoper to calculate the 3 angles. created graph using ycharts. imp thing to note is that the graph doesn't update dynamically so that when a new entity is spawned with time, it doesn't change, so i just hardcoded the data from the logger. and that's the same thing i used to export data to my system using the adb command, and then used a simple linear regression to predict the next value, since it was all the same because my data didn't change over time, the predicted values pretty much match the actual values.

the second question had me follow the tensorflow lite website (which does utillise nnapi), so i downloaded the repo from the android github page and replaced the quantised and floating point models on it with the actual models which i trained using my images. also, the app simply classifies apples and oranges using the device's camera, and seems to have a decent accuracy [teachable ml]
